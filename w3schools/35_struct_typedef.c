/*
typedef
-------
The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which 
you can use to give a type a new name.
Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers.

typedef unsigned char BYTE;

After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an 
abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example:

BYTE  b1, b2;

You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. 
For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type 
and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows:
*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
 
typedef struct Books {
   char title[50];
   char author[50];
   char subject[100];
   int book_id;
} Book;
 
int main( ) {

   Book book;
 
   strcpy( book.title, "C Programming");
   strcpy( book.author, "Nuha Ali"); 
   strcpy( book.subject, "C Programming Tutorial");
   book.book_id = 6495407;
 
   printf( "Book title : %s\n", book.title);
   printf( "Book author : %s\n", book.author);
   printf( "Book subject : %s\n", book.subject);
   printf( "Book book_id : %d\n", book.book_id);

   return 0;
}
